let name = "John";

// embed a variable

There is no character type.
In some languages, there is a special “character” type for a single character. For example, in the C language and in Java it is char.

In JavaScript, there is no such type. There’s only one type: string. A string may consist of only one character or many of them.

The typeof operator returns the type of the argument. It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.

It supports two forms of syntax:

As an operator: typeof x.
As a function: typeof(x).
In other words, it works with parentheses or without them. The result is the same.

The call to typeof x returns a string with the type name:


typeof undefined // "undefined"

typeof 0 // "number"

typeof true // "boolean"

typeof "foo" // "string"

typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"

typeof Math // "object"  (1)

typeof null // "object"  (2)

typeof alert // "function"  (3)
